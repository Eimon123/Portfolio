    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>I am an student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Asia Pacific.
    I earned by SSC in  Science from Kaman Khola O.P.M Accademy and<br> I complete my HSC in Science from Laxmipur govt. collage.
    Now I am studing at University of Asia Pacific.</p>
	<p>I allow myself to forgive, it will allow me to move beyond the pain, to a place of peace.<br>
       I will take the time to notice and be thankful for the little things.I want to be lead a very<br>
	   simple life because of i have no right to hurt others.I always pray my almighty to keep save other <br>
	    and also me.I always follow some rule those are 

    <ul>
    <li>I am thankful for life.</li>

    <li>I accept the good that is flowing into my life.</li>

    <li>Every day, in every way, I am becoming better and better.</li>

    </ul>

	    <h4>Dream Job </h4>
	    <table>
		
	        <caption><strong> I Want To Be A Pilot</strong></caption> 

                <tr>
          			<td> <p>When I grow up, I want to be a PILOT because it's a fun job and easy to do. That's why there are so many PILOTS flying around these days.<br>
					        PILOTS don't need much school, they just have to learn to read numbers so they can read instruments. I guess they should be able to read road maps too,<br> 
					        so they can find their way home if they get lost.<br>
					    </p>

                    <p> PILOTS should be brave so they won't get scared if it's foggy and they can't see, or if a wing or motor falls off they should stay calm<br> 
					    so they'll know what to do. PILOTS have to have good eyes to see through clouds and they can't be afraid of lightning or thunder<br> 
						because they are much closer to them than we are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
				       The salary PILOTS make is another thing I like. They make more money than they know what to do with. This is because most people thing<br> 
					   that PLANE flying is dangerous except PILOTS don't because they know how easy it is. I hope I don't get airsick because I get car sick <br>
					    and if I get airsick I couldn't be a PILOT and then I would have to go to work.<br>

		     <p> I want to be a <strong>researcher</strong> on my own terms. I donâ€™t need to be the highest-funded, have the highest h-index of all time,<br>
			 or work at the most-prestigious university in the world. My goals are (1) build things/ideas with my name on it,<br> 
			 (2) conduct research in a breadth of settings, and (3) get undergraduate college students excited about careers in computer science.<br>
			 I want all of these things to happen in my career in order of soonest-to-latest:</p>
